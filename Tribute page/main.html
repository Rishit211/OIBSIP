             <p><b>Homi Jehangir Bhabha</b> was an Indian nuclear Phycist, founding director, and professor of physics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research(TIFR). Colloquially known as the <b>"Father of the Indian nuclear programme".</b> Bhabha was also the founding director of the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay(AEET) which is now named as Bhabha Atomic Research centre in his honour. TIFR and AEET were the cornerstone of the Indian development of nuclear weapons which Bhabha also supervised as director. He was the first chariman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Atomic Energy.<br>Homi Bhabha was awarded the Adams prize(1942) and Padma Bhushan(1954). He was also nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics in 1951 and 1953-1956.</p>

            <h4>India's Nuclear power programme</h4>
            <p>
                Homi Bhabha was born into a prominent wealthy Parsi family through which was related to businessman Dinshaw Maneckji petit. He was born on 30 October 1909 to Jehangir Hormusji Bhabha a well-known Parsi lawyer and Meheren. He received his early studies at Mumbai's Cathderal and John Connon School.<br>
                Bhabha frequently visited the home of his uncle Dorabji Tata, chariman of the conglomerate Tata group and one of the wealthiest men in India. There he was privy to conversations Dorabji had with national leaders of the independence movement like Mahatma Gandhi and Motilal Nehru as well as business dealings in industries like steel, heavy chemicals and hydeoelectric power which the Tata group invested in John Cockcroft remarked that overhearing these conversations should have inspired Bhabha's career as a scientfic organizer.<br>
                When the Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1948, Bhabha was appointed by the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as its first chairman. The relationship between Bhabha shared wirh Nehru was a friendly one. Twenty years younger than Nehru Bhabha addressed his as "Dear bhai" while Nehru addressed as Bhabha as "My dear Homi".<br>
                Indira Gandhi later recalled that her father always found the time to speak to Bhabha, both because Bhabha brought to him urgent matters that required immediate attention and because conversations with him were refreshing and afforded nehru "warm movements of sensitivity that other people take for granted in their everyday life".<br>
                Bhabha is generally acknowledged as the father of Indian nuclear power. Moreover, he is credited with formulating a strategy of focussing on extracting power from the country's vast thorium reserves rather than its merge uranium reserves. This thorium focused strategy was in marked contrast to all other countries in the world. The approach proposed by Bhabha to achieve this strategic objective became India's three-stage nuclear programme.<br>
                Bhabha gained international prominence after deriving a correct expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as Bhabha Scattering. His major contribution included his work on Compton scattering, R-process, and the advancement of nuclear physics. He later served as the member of Indian cabinet's scientific Advisory committee and provided the pivotal role to Vikram Sarabhai to set up the Indian National Committee for Space Research. He was elected a Foreign Honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958.

            <h4>Assassination Claims</h4>
            <p>
                Bhabha died when Air India Flight 101 crashed near Mont Blanc on 24 January 1966. A misunderstanding between Geneva Airport and the pilot about the aircraft position near the mountain is the official reason of the crash.<br>
                Many possible theories have been advanced for the air crash, including a claim the Central Intelligence Agency(CIA) was involved in paralysing India's nuclear program. An Indian diplomatic bag containing calendars and a presonal letter was recovered near the crash site in 2012.<br>
                Gregory Douglas, a journalist, conspiracy theorist, forger and holocaust denier who claimed to have conducted telephone conversations with the former CIA operative Robert Crowley in 1993, published a book called conversations with the Crow in 2013. Douglas wrote that Crowley said the CIA was responsible for assassinating Homi Bhabha, as well as Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadudr Shastri in 1996, thirteen days apart, to thwart India's nuclear programme.
